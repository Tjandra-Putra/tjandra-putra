# Hi there, I'm [Tjandra!](https://tjandra-putra.github.io) ðŸ‘‹
Hi there! I'm a final-year `Information Systems student` at `Singapore Management University`, currently a `Systems Engineer Intern` at `Pure Storage`. I specialize in software development, with hands-on experience in full stack engineering, frontend/UI development, and data & business analytics.

I thrive in fast-paced, impact-driven environments â€” whether Iâ€™m building scalable web applications, automating processes, or designing user-friendly dashboards. I enjoy solving complex problems and turning ideas into intuitive, real-world solutions that enhance both customer experiences and team performance.

My tech stack includes React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Python, Tableau, and more. Iâ€™m always excited to learn and grow. Iâ€™m particularly passionate about creating clean, responsive interfaces and leveraging data to drive decision-making.

Letâ€™s connect if you're into collaboration, innovation, and building things that matter!
(And on the side, I make piano & cello covers on YouTube as @remixowl ðŸŽµ).
